Power set with Power 2
markAsDonemarkForRevisionmarkForLater
Given is an array arr[] of size N. Return the number of non-empty subsequences such that the product of all numbers in the subsequence is Power of 2. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
Output Format

Print the required number of subsequence modulo 10^9 + 7.
Input 1:

3
1 6 2
Output 1:

3
Explanation:

The subsequence that can be chosen are {1}, {2} and {1,2}.
Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
Example
Input
3
1 6 2
Output
3

Bleak Numbers
markAsDonemarkForRevisionmarkForLater
Given an integer N, check whether it is Bleak or not.

A number N is called Bleak if it cannot be represented as sum of a positive number x and set bit count in x, i.e., x + countSetBits(x) is not equal to n for any non-negative number x.

Input Format

The first line contains a single positive integer N.
Output Format

Print "1" if the given number is a Bleak otherwise "0".
Input 1:

4
Output 1:

1
Explanation:

There is no any possible x such that x + countSetbit(x) = 4.
Input 2:

3
Output 2:

0
Explanation:

3 is a Bleak number as 2 + countSetBit(2) = 3.
Constraints:Given a sorted array arr[] of N positive integers having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, except for one number which will occur only once. Find the number occurring only once.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
Output Format

Print the number which occurs only once in the array.
Input 1:

5
1 1 2 5 5
Output 1:

2
Explanation:

Since 2 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 2 is the answer.
Input 2:

7
2 2 5 5 20 30 30
Output 2:

20
Explanation:

Since 20 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 20 is the answer.
Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
Example
Input
7
2 2 5 5 20 30 30
Output
20

Missing and Repeating Integers

Given an unsorted array arr of size N of positive integers. One number A from set {1, 2, …N} is missing and one number B occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output Format
Two separated integers first being the Repeated number and other will be the missing integer.
Sample Input 1
3
1 3 3
Sample Output 1
3 2
Explanation:

Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
Constraints:

2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ N
There will be exactly one integer which will appear 2 times in the array and one integer will be missing.
Example
Input
3
1 3 3
Output
3 2
54

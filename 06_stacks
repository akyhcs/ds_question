markAsDonemarkForRevisionmarkForLater
Write a program to reverse a stack using recursion. You are not allowed to use loop constructs like while, for.. etc., and you can only use the following functions on Stack S:
isEmpty(S)
push(S)
pop(S)

Input Format

First Line contains 
1
≤
n
≤
10
3
 elements for a stack. Next Line contains the n elements of stack.
Output Format

Line containing elements of stack printed in reverse order.
Example 1

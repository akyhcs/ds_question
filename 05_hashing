Consecutive Elements

Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to check whether the array consists of consecutive numbers or not.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array.
The second line of each case contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Transform Boolean Matrix
markAsDonemarkForRevisionmarkForLater
Given a boolean matrix of size R x C where each cell contains either 0 or 1, modify it such that if a matrix cell matrix[i][j] is 1 then all the cells in its ith row and jth column will become 1.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integer R and C, number of rows and number of columns of matrices respectively.
The next R lines each contain C integers separated by spaces describing rows of matrix (each element of the matrix is either 0 or 1).
Output Format

Print the modified matrix.
Input:

2
2 2
1 0
0 0
4 3
1 0 0

1 0 0
0 0 0
Output:

1 1
1 0
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 0 0
Explanation:

Testcase1: Only cell that has 1 is at (0,0) so all cells in row 0 are modified to 1 and all cells in column 0 are modified to 1.
Testcase2: The position of cells that have 1 in the original matrix are (0,0), (1,0) and (2,0). Therefore, all cells in row 0,1,2 are and column 0 are modified to 1.
Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^3
0 ≤ MATRIX[i][j] ≤ 1
